            <p>The main difference between "let" and "const" is that "let" allows the variable to be reassigned, while "const" creates a read-only reference to a value that cannot be reassigned.</p>

                <p>An object in JavaScript is a collection of properties containing primitive data types, such as strings, numbers, booleans, and functions. An object can also have other objects as its values. Objects are used to model real-world entities and help organize code into reusable components.

                    They are defined using curly braces "{}" and properties are defined as key-value pairs separated by a colon ":".</p>

                    <p>A function in JavaScript is a reusable piece of code that can be used to perform a specific task. Functions are defined using the keyword "function" followed by a name and parentheses "( )". The code inside the parentheses is the body of the function, which contains instructions for how it should behave.</p>

                        <p>In JavaScript, null and undefined are two distinct values that represent the absence of a value.

                            The main difference between the two is that null is an assignment value, while undefined indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value. Additionally, null can be explicitly used to indicate the absence of a value, while undefined cannot.</p>

                            <p>== (called loose equal) is used to compare two variables regardless of the variable's data type.

                                === (called strict equal) is used to compare two variables, but this will check strict type, which means it will check the data type and compare two values.

                                <p>An array in JavaScript is an ordered list of elements containing any data type, including primitive types such as strings and numbers, objects, and other arrays. Arrays are used to store collections of data and can be iterated over using loops like forEach().

                                    They are defined using square brackets "[]" and elements are separated by commas ",".</p>
